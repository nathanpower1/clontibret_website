    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Clontibret Senior Football Champions 2019</h1>
    <p><h4>Referee:</h4> S Hagan (Sean McDermotts)</p>
    <h4>The league system in Monaghan is unforgiving and a poor start meant Clontibret faced into the final two league matches needing to win to preserve their senior status. A year later, they are kings of Monaghan.</h4>
    <p>    Theirs was a surprisingly routine win. By half-time, they had built up a six point lead (0-9 to 0-3). Conor McManus' finger prints were all over Clontibret's best work but war horses Dessie Mone and Vinnie Corey had some big moments too. That pair picked up their seventh respective county medals yesterday.</p>        
    <p>    Scotstown will point to first-half goal chances. For the first one, Conor McCarthy did brilliantly to create the chance out of nothing and when he rounded Darren McDonnell he looked certain to goal.</p>
    <p>    However Conor Boyle recovered brilliantly to make a goal-line stop</p>
    <p>Six minutes later, McCarthy was put through by Kieran Hughes but he blazed high and wide from a difficult angle. At the other end, Clontibret were a model of efficiency and kicked just one first-half wide.

        And when McManus booted over a beautiful '45 to end the first half, Clontibret looked firmly in control against a misfiring Scotstown who had managed just a point from play overall.
        
        The defending champions were expected to whip up some sort of storm but it was Clontibret who hit the first three points of the half to open up a nine-point lead with 20 minutes to go.</p>
    <p>Eventually they found some rhythm and they kicked six of the game's next seven points to cut the gap to four.

        But just as they looked like they could apply some pressure on Clontibret, McManus picked out Ryan McGuigan with a clever pass and he finished low to the net to seal the win for McEntee's men.</p>
